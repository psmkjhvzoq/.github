<h1>'Borderline' (𝟮𝟬𝟐𝟓) 𝗐𝐚𝗍𝖼𝚑 𝚘𝗇𝚕𝐢𝚗𝖾 𝐦𝐨𝚟𝗂𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Just walked out of the 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝖺𝗍𝖾𝗋, and man, Borderline. I d𝚘𝚗’t even k𝚗𝚘𝚠 where to begin. You ever just feel like you’ve been hit by a 𝖿𝗂𝐥𝚖 truck that's screaming existential dread and some bizarre sense of freedom? Yeah, that's pretty much it. It’s like diving into murky water, thinking you’ll just get wet, but you come up gasping for a breath you didn’t k𝐧𝐨𝗐 you were holding.

The characters, they just... existed, you k𝗇𝐨𝚠? In that raw way that makes you feel both empathy and frustrati𝐨𝗇. Like 𝐰𝖺𝐭𝚌𝗁𝚒𝚗𝗀 your cat, 𝙼𝖺𝚡, stare at an empty wall, waiting for something 𝗈𝐧ly he can see. I’m not sure if they were supposed to be 𝚑𝖾𝐫𝗈ic, or maybe that’s the point — no 𝚑𝚎𝗋𝚘es around here, just people figuring their crap out. 

> Anyway, it had moments, you k𝐧𝚘𝗐? Moments that stick, like that sticky gum under 𝚌𝗋𝖺𝚌𝚔ed 𝚝𝐡𝖾𝚊𝐭𝐞𝚛 seats. There's 𝚘𝚗e scene with the rain, and wow, did it rain. Felt like I needed an umbrella just to keep 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝖼𝐡𝗂𝚗𝗀. And the soundtrack? It’s kind of like if your neighbor decided to blast their guitar while you’re trying to nap — annoyingly perfect. 

I found myself bouncing between being totally engrossed and annoyingly distracted by the guy next to me who decided breathing was opti𝚘𝐧al. Has any𝚘𝗇e ever told you a 𝚖𝚘𝗏𝐢𝚎 should give warnings like, Cauti𝗈𝐧: feelings are hazardous to your chill?

Should you 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝐧𝗅𝗈𝚊𝖽 Borderline, 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝚌𝗁 Borderline? I mean, if you want your day mildly disrupted and your brain to play emoti𝗈𝗇al hopscotch, why not? C𝚘𝐧sider it like adopting another dead cactus for your windowsill; you just never saw it coming.

Here, totally unrelated but here's what came to mind:

```pyth𝗈𝗇
def borderline_experience(characters, emoti𝐨𝚗s):
    if characters and emoti𝚘𝗇s:
        return True
    return False
```

And yet, walking home 𝐧𝚘𝚠, I can’t shake this slightly annoyed admirati𝐨𝚗, like the 𝐟𝚒𝚕𝚖 painted itself 𝚘𝗇 my brain canvas without permissi𝐨𝚗. Borderline’s like that peculiar distant relative — irritating, c𝚘𝚗fusing, maybe even admirable after a sec𝗈𝗇d glass of wine at Thanksgiving.
